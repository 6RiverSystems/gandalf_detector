Gandalf - Generic ANd DistAnce-invariant Laser Features

The Gandalf detector is an open source C++ ROS package for object detection based on generic-distance invariant range scan features. 

The detector can be trained for detection and distinction of different objects. For our application we trained it for the detection and destinction of the three object classes 1) person without walking aid, 2) person in a wheelchair, and 3) person with a walker. The trained model for detection and distinction of these objects is provided with this detector. 

The detector is not fully ported to ROS until yet. Especially the multi object detection node (gandalf_mo_detector_node) is not commited yet. 
To test the detector without object classification run: roslaunch gandalf_detector gandalf_detector.launch
